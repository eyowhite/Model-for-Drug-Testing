### Project Overview

Our client required a [predictive model](https://eyowhite.com/projects/) that accurately categorises individuals into drug groups based on specific input variables. 

### Project Aim
To create a fitting model that predicts the drug group of an individual taking the Age, Gender, BP, BMI as an entry point.

### Project Methodology
- Platform: Azure ML Studio.
- Machine Learning Problem: Multiclass Classification
- Fitting (training) Model adopted: Multiclass decision Forest.
- Dataset Used: Drugtest.csv

### Model Scores and Evaluation

Model score â€“ On testing using 30% of the dataset, the model score indicates an almost even distribution of the target variable, Drug Group as shown:

### Project Outcomes
Accurate prediction of drug groups indicated by high accuracy, precision, F1 and recall scores demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.
